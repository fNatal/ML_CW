Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions
Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Two machine learning models, Random Forest and Neural Network, were implemented from scratch to classify clients as Yes (will subscribe) or No (will not subscribe). This implementation demonstrates a strong understanding of machine learning principles while addressing a real-world problem in banking and marketing.

Key Features
Custom Implementation:
Random Forest Classifier developed from scratch using decision trees and majority voting.
Neural Network built from scratch using NumPy for forward and backward propagation.
Binary Classification:
Models predict a binary outcome (Yes or No) for term deposit subscription.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Bank Marketing Dataset, available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains client demographic data, campaign details, and economic indicators.

Attributes
Client Information: age, job, marital, education, etc.
Campaign Details: contact, month, day_of_week, etc.
Economic Indicators: emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx, cons.conf.idx, etc.
Target Variable: y (whether the client subscribed to a term deposit: Yes or No).
Models
Random Forest Classifier
Implementation: Built from scratch using decision trees.
